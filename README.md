# Quick-sorting-with-Pthread

**The Problem: Quick sorting with Pthread**

1.  **Using Pthread Library under c/c++ write a program to implement a
    quicksort for N elements.**

2.  **Your program should create four threads to work in parallel to
    solve this kind of sorting problem.**

3.  **You must include all required functions:**

-   **Main function :** Drive the code and have the threads creation

-   **Partition function:** This function takes last element as pivot,
    places the pivot element at its correct position in sorted array,
    and places all smaller (smaller than pivot) to left of pivot and all
    greater elements to right of pivot

-   **Swap function:** A utility function to swap two elements

-   **Sorting function:** The main function that implements QuickSort

-   **Print array function:** Function to print an array after sorting
    process

4.  **What to deliver on the class room to submit this assignment
    correctly and efficiently :**

-   **Source code file with .exe (serial version)**

-   **Source code file with .exe (Parallel version)**

5.  **How to start**

-   **Read the notes carefully and study the example in the table below.
    (understand how the quicksort works)**

-   **Implement the serial quicksort version first, and then check the
    results.**

-   **Implement the parallel version using Pthread library.**

-   **Compare your results with the serial implementation results to
    ensure the validity of threads creation and joining.**
